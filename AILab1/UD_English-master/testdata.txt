what

what

(
and
,
by
the
way
,
is
anybody
else
just
a
little
nostalgic
for
the
days
when
that
was
a
good
thing
?
)

this
buzzmachine
post
argues
that
google
's
rush
toward
ubiquity
might
backfire
--
which
we
've
all
heard
before
,
but
it
's
particularly
well
-
put
in
this
post
.

google
is
a
nice
search
engine
.

does
anybody
use
it
for
anything
else
?

they
own
blogger
,
of
course
.

is
that
a
money
maker
?

i
'm
staying
away
from
the
stock
.

i
doubt
the
very
few
who
actually
read
my
blog
have
not
come
across
this
yet
,
but
i
figured
i
would
put
it
out
there
anyways
.

john
donovan
from
argghhh!
has
put
out
a
excellent
slide
show
on
what
was
actually
found
and
fought
for
in
fallujah
.

click
here
to
view
it
.

he
makes
some
good
observations
on
a
few
of
the
pic's
.

one
of
the
pictures
shows
a
flag
that
was
found
in
fallujah
.

on
the
next
two
pictures
he
took
screenshots
of
two
beheading
video's
.

compare
the
flags
to
the
fallujah
one
.

you
have
to
see
these
slides
....
they
are
amazing
.

this
fallujah
operation
my
turn
out
to
be
the
most
important
operation
done
by
the
us
military
since
the
end
of
the
war
.

let
me
join
the
chorus
of
annoyance
over
google
's
new
toolbar
,
which
,
as
noted
in
the
linked
article
,
commits
just
about
every
sin
an
online
marketer
could
commit
,
and
makes
up
a
few
new
ones
besides
.

i
'm
not
fond
of
the
google
-
hates
-
privacy
argument

(
you
do
n't
need
to
use
their
site
,
you
can
opt
-
out
of
sharing
your
information
,
you
do
n't
need
to
send
stuff
to
anyone
with
a
gmail
account
,
and
if
--
wonder
of
wonders
--
you
're
worried
that
you
might
send
something
to
someone
who
would
forward
an
excerpt
to
someone
who
would
then
store
it
on
a
gmail
account
...
you
have
far
,
far
too
much
time
on
your
hands
)
.

however
,
this
toolbar
is
really
bad
news
.

on
the
other
hand
,
it
looks
pretty
cool
.

iran
says
it
is
creating
nuclear
energy
without
wanting
nuclear
weapons
.

the
united
states
does
n't
believe
the
iranian
government
.

one
can
suspect
the
iranian
government
.

but
there
is
no
proof
.

i
read
an
article
in
time
magazine
accusing
the
iranian
government
of
being
willing
to
start
a
nuclear
war
and
i
sympathise
with
the
article
.

they
are
certainly
being
nasty
to
the
united
nations
security
council
in
connection
with
the
anti-proliferation
treaty
.

the
president
has
also
said
he
would
like
to
see
israel
wiped
off
the
map
which
he
could
n't
even
begin
to
try
without
nuclear
weapons
.

but
he
has
insisted
that
he
wants
nuclear
power
for
peaceful
purposes
.

many
people
want
to
use
diplomacy
with
iran
rather
than
military
pressure
.

but
will
diplomacy
work
?

and
can
anyone
use
military
pressure
without
proof
?

one
reader
pointed
out
that
the
president
watched
the
americans
in
the
embassy
when
they
took
them
hostage
.

he
has
denied
this
.

we
do
n't
have
to
believe
him
.

but
we
ca
n't
prove
it
.

it
does
seem
that
iranians
frequently
make
statements
and
then
hide
behind
lack
of
proof
.

angry
crowds
chanted
anti-american
slogans
in
the
western
city
of
falluja
(
pop.
256,000
)
as
the
security
police
killed
in
a
friendly
fire
incident
by
us
troops
were
buried
on
saturday
.

reuters
reported
that
"
sunni
clerics
in
the
town
issued
a
'
declaration
by
the
people
of
fallujah
'
condemning
the
deaths
of
the
security
guards
and
police
,
announcing
three
days
of
mourning
,
and
calling
for
a
general
strike
today
.
"

it
read
,
"
the
people
of
fallujah
condemn
the
massacre
which
was
committed
on
friday
against
people
dedicated
to
the
protection
of
fallujah
.

let
aggressive
(
american
)
leaders
and
soldiers
know
that
we
are
capable
of
protecting
the
city
's
security
and
safety
,
and
ask
them
to
lift
their
hands
from
the
city
.
"

the
clerics
demanded
talks
with
local
us
commanders
.

falluja
has
long
been
roiled
by
tense
relations
with
the
us
soldiers
there
,
since
local
sunnis
either
remain
committed
to
arab
nationalism
or
have
become
sunni
fundamentalists
or
even
radicals
.

cities
such
as
falluja
received
special
treatment
from
saddam
and
enjoyed
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
country
's
wealth
and
power
.

they
know
that
the
american
advent
implies
for
them
a
demotion
,
and
an
elevation
of
the
shiites
and
kurds
,
and
they
refuse
to
go
quietly
.

i
'll
post
highlights
from
the
opinion
and
dissents
when
i
'm
finished
.

important
news
such
as
president
bush
's
miniscule
calibrations
on
his
marriage
amendment
/
anti-gay
(
update
:
he
's
not
against
gays
in
the
bedroom
,
just
at
the
altar
,
where
of
course
their
relationships
should
not
only
be
frowned
upon
but
should
be
constitutionally
excluded
)
has
pushed
sudan
not
just
off
the
front
pages
,
or
the
a
section
,
but
out
of
the
ny
times
and
washington
post
completely
.

i
had
to
go
to
the
bbc
for
this
report
.

it
's
symptomatic
,
i
suppose
,
of
our
fast
-
paced
,
24
hour
news
-
cycle
lives
,
that
the
biggest
short
-
term
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
world
would
quickly
be
eclipsed
,
once
our
secretary
of
state
was
finished
with
his
whirlwind
tour
,
from
the
newspapers
.

it
's
just
disappointing
.

most
troubling
,
however
,
is
the
fact
that
the
political
will
to
end
the
crisis
expressed
a
few
short
weeks
ago
seems
to
have
ebbed
.

at
that
time
,
un
secretary
general
kofi
annan
demanded
steps
be
taken
to
end
the
ethnic
violence
in
darfur
within
48
hours
.

two
weeks
later
,
and
the
violence
continues
.

the
african
union
is
clearly
not
up
to
the
task
of
keeping
the
peace
,
pledging
300
troops
to
an
area
that
will
need
15,000
,
according
to
analysts
.

and
international
donors
have
given
only
half
of
the
relief
aid
that
darfur
needs
,
according
to
the
local
un
officials
.

so
hear
we
are
,
two
weeks
later
,
after
that
dazzling
pr
display
two
weeks
ago
by
powell
and
annan
,
and
the
situation
on
the
ground
in
darfur
appears
basically
unchanged
.

warren
buffett
is
giving
away
85
%
of
his
wealth
,
mostly
to
the
bill
and
melinda
gates
foundation
.

it
's
a
move
that
really
worries
me
;
buffett
's
usual
justification
for
keeping
most
of
his
money
was
that
he
was
still
compounding
the
value
of
his
fortune
at
a
pretty
high
rate
,
so
any
gifts
now
would
mean
significantly
less
money
for
the
foundation
later
.

it
's
a
little
hard
to
parse
,
but
at
this
point
his
ostensible
view
is
that
the
gateses
are
very
good
money
-
redistributors
,
and
he
wants
them
to
have
the
money
as
soon
as
possible
.

which
essentially
sounds
like
he
's
worried
that
bill
or
melinda
are
going
to
die
soon
.

i
assume
his
actual
reason
is
that
he
's
worried
that
berkshire
hathaway
just
ca
n't
grow
quickly
enough
to
justify
his
usual
charity
policy
.

i
'm
not
sure
how
the
market
will
react
.

it
does
n't
change
the
company
's
intrinsic
worth
,
and
as
the
article
notes
,
the
company
might
be
added
to
a
major
index
once
the
shares
get
more
liquid
.

on
the
other
hand
,
this
is
essentially
a
statement
that
the
company
is
overpriced
from
the
guy
who
knows
it
best
--
and
happens
to
be
the
best
investor
of
the
last
century
.

em
...
no
...
the
gates
foundation
mainly
invests
in
medical
research
and
education
,
that
means
donating
now
adds
a
tremendous
value
compared
to
donating
in
ten
years
.

because
the
10.000.000
people
dying
from
malaria
will
otherwise
be
dead
.

i.e
.

he
's
not
giving
85
%
away
,
he
's
giving
a
number
of
shares
each
year
that
decrease
in
number
at
the
rate
of
5
%
a
year
(
until
gone
?
)
.

he
mentions
his
wife
's
death
having
an
effect
on
him
.

it
sounds
pretty
rational
that
he
's
saying
that
bill
and
melinda
are
at
a
prime
spot
,
so
starting
the
money
hose
now
is
a
good
idea
,
but
buffet
is
still
keeping
most
of
his
donation
inside
of
berkshire
where
it
will
compound
.

bill
over
at
the
fourth
rail
has
an
excellent
essay
on
how
the
msm
and
the
un
,
even
the
leftist
countries
in
europe
,
are
basically
accepting
terrorist
organizations
as
legitimate
forms
of
a
political
party
:

on
the
same
day
palestinians
protest
in
support
of
hezbollah
and
syria
,
the
terrorist
group
hamas
has
indicated
it
will
participate
in
the
scheduled
upcoming
parliamentary
elections
.

to
the
north
in
lebanon
,
there
is
serious
debate
within
hezbollah
about
entering
the
lebanese
political
process
in
light
of
syria
's
promised
withdrawal
.

syria
has
agreed
to
withdraw
under
the
conditions
set
forth
in
unsc
resolution
1559
,
which
has
already
begun
.

un
secretary
-
general
kofi
annan
has
indicated
it
is
time
to
"
recognize
hezbollah
"
after
easily
being
duped
by
"
the
message
on
the
placards
they
are
using
"
.

this
acceptance
of
blatantly
terrorist
groups
as
legitimate
freedom
movements
is
a
cancerous
tumor
on
the
united
nations
and
the
media
.

over
three
years
after
9-11
,
the
united
nations
,
despite
their
attempts
to
project
strength
in
fighting
terrorism
,
still
can
not
properly
define
the
word
"
terrorist
"
,
waffling
over
the
issue
of
whether
the
murder
of
innocent
civilians
are
terrorist
acts
.

the
media
routinely
obscures
the
lines
between
terrorism
and
legitimate
resistance
,
as
the
recent
article
by
daniel
okrent
of
the
new
york
times
demonstrates
.

...

the
decision
to
sidestep
the
obvious
to
satisfy
the
need
to
avoid
confrontation
does
not
bring
peace
,
but
only
delays
the
eventual
conflict
as
the
predators
of
hamas
and
hezbollah
exploit
the
inherent
weakness
of
the
internationals
and
the
media
.

i
've
been
fuming
over
this
fact
for
a
few
weeks
now
,
ever
since
some
organizations
and
governments
suggested
we
need
to
accept
the
fact
that
hezbollah
will
get
involved
in
running
lebanon
.

wtf
is
this
?

this
is
a
terrorist
organization
plain
and
simple
.

this
is
the
organization
that
bombed
our
marine
barracks
in
1983
,
took
americans
hostage
throughout
the
80's
and
now
they
should
be
considered
a
legitimate
organization
?

this
is
just
another
reason
to
never
trust
the
msm
,
and
certainly
not
the
europeans
.

the
iraqi
islamic
party
lead
by
muhsin
abdul
hamid
,
has
been
among
the
few
sunni
muslim
groups
willing
to
cooperate
(
even
if
rather
lukewarmly
)
with
the
americans
.

it
is
now
threatening
to
pull
out
of
the
allawi
caretaker
government
.

the
iip
had
also
been
the
main
force
urging
sunni
arabs
to
participate
in
the
elections
scheduled
for
january
,
and
had
been
opposed
in
this
stance
by
the
association
of
muslim
scholars
.

that
the
iraqi
islamic
party
is
now
contemplating
leaving
the
allawi
government
raises
the
question
of
whether
a
mass
sunni
arab
boycott
of
the
elections
is
in
the
offing
,
thus
fatally
weakening
the
legitimacy
of
any
new
government
.

az
-
zaman
:
the
association
of
muslim
scholars
forbade
iraqis
to
participate
in
the
attack
on
fallujah
with
the
americans
.

in
a
communique
,
the
ams
said
that
for
iraqis
to
take
part
with
"
raiding
forces
"
in
the
assault
on
a
city
,
the
population
of
which
is
muslim
(
such
as
fallujah
)
would
be
considered
the
most
mortal
of
mortal
sins
.

the
sunni
ams
told
iraqis
,
"
you
sinned
when
you
participated
with
occupation
forces
in
the
assault
on
najaf
,
and
beware
lest
you
repeat
this
same
sin
in
fallujah
.

remember
that
the
occupation
is
emphemeral
.
"

the
radical
shiite
sadr
movement
issued
a
statement
forbidding
the
participation
of
iraqi
troops
in
the
attack
on
fallujah
,
as
well
.

the
statement
said
,
"
we
direct
an
appeal
at
the
men
in
the
iraqi
forces
,
whether
national
guards
or
others
,
the
majority
of
whom
are
muslim
,
calling
upon
them
to
refrain
for
commiting
this
enormous
sin
under
the
banner
of
forces
that
do
not
respect
our
religion
or
any
principles
of
basic
humanity
,
and
we
ask
them
to
view
this
war
as
illegal
.
"

it
called
a
"
ploy
"
the
assertaion
that
the
attack
was
merely
on
foreign
fighters
at
fallujah
.

the
convergence
of
views
among
the
more
militant
sunni
muslim
clerics
of
ams
and
the
radical
shiites
of
the
sadr
movement
has
been
seen
before
,
last
spring
during
the
initial
us
assault
on
fallujah
and
during
the
us
attack
on
mahdi
army
militiamen
in
najaf
.

most
shiites
,
however
,
are
still
reluctant
to
take
major
risks
to
support
the
sunnis
of
fallujah
,
many
of
whom
had
supported
saddam
and
his
anti-shiite
pogroms
.

president
bush
pinched
a
few
nerves
yesterday
with
his
choice
of
words
:

washington
(
reuters
)
-

u.s.
muslim
groups
criticized
president
bush
on
thursday
for
calling
a
foiled
plot
to
blow
up
airplanes
part
of
a
"
war
with
islamic
fascists
,
"
saying
the
term
could
inflame
anti-muslim
tensions
.

u.s.
officials
have
said
the
plot
,
thwarted
by
britain
,
to
blow
up
several
aircraft
over
the
atlantic
bore
many
of
the
hallmarks
of
al
qaeda
.

"
we
believe
this
is
an
ill
-
advised
term
and
we
believe
that
it
is
counterproductive
to
associate
islam
or
muslims
with
fascism
,
"
said
nihad
awad
,
executive
director
of
the
council
on
american
-
islamic
relations
advocacy
group
.

which
is
why
he
did
n't
say
we
're
at
war
with
islamic
people
.

we
're
at
war
with
islamic
fascists
.

by
using
the
word
"
islamic
"
as
an
adjective
bush
was
purposely
not
associating
muslims
with
fascism
,
hence
the
qualifier
.

we
've
got
a
steven
,
the
one
word
that
did
n't
crash
my
spell
-
check
,
despite
it
being
followed
by
a
vikash
chand
abdul
shakur
.

folks
,
if
it
's
islamic
,
and
fascist
,
it
's
an
islamic
fascist
.

but
because
we
do
n't
want
to
sound
hateful
we
must
pretend
everyone
's
a
possible
suspect
and
make
airline
travel
more
miserable
than
it
's
ever
been
.

on
the
internet
site
of
monotheism
and
holy
war
(
al
-
tawhid
wa
al
-
jihad
)
,
the
group
allegedly
declared
,
"
we
announce
that
the
tawhid
and
jihad
group
,
its
prince
and
soldiers
,
have
pledged
allegiance
to
the
sheikh
of
the
mujahideen
osama
bin
laden
.
"

this
pledge
is
a
new
development
.

abu
musab
al
-
zarqawi
and
his
group
are
said
to
have
been
bitter
rivals
of
al
-
qaeda
during
the
afghan
resistance
days
.

one
witness
at
the
moutasaddiq
trial
in
germany
alleged
that
zarqawi
had
not
allowed
monotheism
and
holy
war
to
share
resources
with
al
-
qaeda
in
the
early
zeroes
of
the
21st
century
.

if
the
statement
is
true
,
it
is
a
worrying
sign
that
even
the
divided
small
radical
guerrilla
groups
are
being
"
picked
up
"
by
al
-
qaeda
.

this
consolidation
is
obviously
a
result
of
bush
's
aggressive
invasion
of
iraq
and
of
the
botching
of
the
aftermath
.

it
is
a
setback
for
the
war
on
terror
.

al
-
qaeda
in
afghanistan
was
a
group
of
only
a
few
hundred
"
afghan
arabs
"
who
pledged
personal
loyalty
to
usamah
bin
laden
.

it
could
notionally
be
expanded
to
encompass
the
5,000
-
strong
"
55th
brigade
"
of
the
taliban
regime
,
though
this
is
not
the
technical
definition
.

because
usamah
is
saudi
,
my
guess
is
that
they
were
especially
influenced
by
an
extremist
form
of
the
wahhabi
school
of
islam
that
predominates
among
saudia
's
some
15
million
citizens
.

in
1998
they
were
joined
by
egyptians
from
the
al
-
jihad
al
-
islami
group
of
ayman
al
-
zawahiri
(
many
of
these
were
from
upper
egypt
,
especially
asyut
and
environs
)
.

after
that
point
,
al
-
qaeda
was
a
joint
enterprise
between
the
egyptian
extremists
and
the
polyglot
arabs
around
bin
laden
,
only
some
of
whom
were
saudi
.

zarqawi
is
a
jordanian
,
and
his
monotheism
and
holy
war
group
in
afghanistan
probably
had
a
distinctive
coloration
as
mainly
jordanian
,
palestinian
and
syrian
.

they
also
had
a
special
connection
to
some
extremists
in
jordan
and
germany
.

they
are
probably
especially
oriented
toward
the
salafi
school
of
modern
islamic
thought
,
which
has
a
protestant
-
like
emphasis
on
going
back
to
the
original
practice
of
the
early
companions
of
the
prophet
muhammad
.

(
most
salafis
are
not
militant
or
violent
,
though
they
tend
to
be
rather
narrow
-
minded
in
my
experience
,
on
the
order
of
protestant
pietists
)
.

monotheism
and
holy
war
obviously
does
have
a
violent
interpretation
of
salafism
,
rather
as
the
the
leaders
of
the
so
-
called
german
peasant
rebellion
among
early
protestants
did
.

another
worrisome
sign
is
that
local
iraqi
sunni
fundamentalists
opposed
to
the
us
presence
in
iraq
have
begun
joining
monotheism
and
holy
war
,
and
wearing
its
distinctive
orange
and
black
insignia
.

these
have
been
sighted
among
iraqi
crowds
on
haifa
street
in
baghdad
and
in
samarra
.

so
now
there
are
hundreds
of
al
-
qaeda
members
in
iraq
where
there
had
been
none
before
.

the
consolidation
of
smaller
local
radical
fundamentalist
groups
with
al
-
qaeda
can
also
be
seen
in
the
case
of
the
fizazi
group
in
tangiers
that
morphed
into
the
moroccan
islamic
combatant
group
,
had
members
who
met
with
september
11
ringleader
muhammad
atta
,
and
ultimately
was
in
part
responsible
for
the
madrid
train
bombings
.

the
september
11
panel
will
issue
its
findings
on
thursday
.

it
notes
10
points
at
which
the
us
made
key
mistakes
that
might
have
stopped
bin
laden
's
plot
.

four
of
these
were
under
clinton
and
6
under
bush
.

bush
came
out
today
and
said
that
if
he
had
known
what
was
coming
,
he
would
have
expended
every
effort
to
stop
it
,
and
that
so
would
have
clinton
.

this
statement
is
,
despite
its
facade
of
fair
-
mindedness
,
so
many
weasel
words
.

of
course
bush
would
have
tried
to
stop
9/11
if
he
had
known
it
was
coming
.

the
question
is
,
"
should
he
have
known
it
was
coming
?
"

the
answer
is
,
"
yes
!
"

we
now
know
that
bush
and
his
administration
came
into
office
obsessed
with
iraq
.

cheney
was
looking
at
maps
of
iraq
oil
fields
and
muttering
about
opportunities
for
us
companies
there
,
already
in
january
or
february
of
2001
.

wolfowitz
contradicted
counter-terrorism
czar
richard
clarke
when
the
latter
spoke
of
the
al
-
qaeda
threat
,
insisting
that
the
preeminent
threat
of
terrorism
against
the
us
came
from
iraq
,
and
indicating
he
accepted
laurie
mylroie
's
crackpot
conspiracy
theory
that
saddam
was
behind
the
1993
world
trade
towers
bombing
.

if
you
believe
crackpot
theories
instead
of
focusing
on
the
reality
--
that
was
an
al
-
qaeda
operation
mainly
carried
out
by
al
-
gamaa
al
-
islamiyyah
,
an
egyptian
terrorist
component
allied
with
bin
laden
--
then
you
will
concentrate
on
the
wrong
threat
.

even
after
the
attacks
on
september
11
,
bush
was
obsessing
about
iraq
.

wolfowitz
lied
to
him
and
said
that
there
was
a
10
to
50
%
chance
that
iraq
was
behind
them
.

(
on
what
evidence
?

the
hijackers
were
obviously
al
-
qaeda
,
and
no
operational
links
between
al
-
qaeda
and
iraq
had
ever
been
found
)
.

rumsfeld
initially
rejected
an
attack
on
al
-
qaeda
bases
in
afghanistan
,
saying
there
were
"
no
good
targets
"
in
afghanistan
.

(
what
about
40
al
-
qaeda
bases
that
had
trained
the
9/11
hijackers
and
other
terrorists
gunning
for
the
united
states
??
)

the
pentagon
did
not
even
have
a
plan
for
dealing
with
afghanistan
or
al
-
qaeda
that
it
could
pull
off
the
shelf
,
according
to
bob
woodward
.

bush
did
not
have
his
eye
on
the
ball
.

neither
did
cheney
,
rumsfeld
,
or
wolfowitz
.

they
were
playing
captain
ahab
to
saddam
's
great
white
whale
.

imperial
hubris
makes
the
case
that
lots
of
people
in
the
cia
and
counter-terrorism
divisions
elsewhere
in
the
us
government
knew
all
about
bin
laden
and
the
threat
he
posed
.

they
were
from
all
accounts
marginalized
and
not
listened
to
.

bush
demoted
dick
clarke
,
among
the
most
vocal
and
focused
of
the
al
-
qaeda
experts
,
from
his
cabinet
.

dick
could
never
thereafter
get
any
real
cooperation
from
the
cabinet
officers
,
who
outranked
him
,
and
he
could
not
convince
them
to
go
to
battle
stations
in
the
summer
of
2001
when
george
tenet
's
hair
was
"
on
fire
"
about
the
excited
chatter
the
cia
was
picking
up
from
radical
islamist
terrorists
.

as
for
the
clinton
administration
,
let
me
say
one
thing
in
its
defense
.

clinton
had
worked
out
a
deal
with
pakistani
prime
minister
nawaz
sharif
in
summer
of
1999
that
would
have
allowed
the
us
to
send
a
special
ops
team
in
after
bin
laden
in
qandahar
,
based
from
pakistan
.

i
presume
you
need
the
pakistan
base
for
rescue
operations
in
case
anything
went
wrong
.

you
also
need
pakistani
air
space
.

the
plan
was
all
set
and
could
have
succeeded
.

but
in
fall
of
1999
,
gen.
pervez
musharraf
made
a
coup
against
nawaz
sharif
.

the
pakistani
army
was
rife
with
elements
protective
of
the
taliban
,
and
the
new
military
government
reneged
on
the
deal
.

musharraf
told
clinton
he
could
n't
use
pakistani
soil
or
air
space
to
send
the
team
in
against
bin
laden
.

look
at
a
map
and
you
try
to
figure
out
how
,
in
fall
of
1999
,
you
could
possibly
pull
off
such
an
operation
without
pakistani
facilities
.

of
course
,
you
could
just
go
in
by
main
force
.

but
for
those
of
you
tempted
in
that
direction
,
please
look
up
carter
's
tabas
operation
.

it
should
be
easily
googled
.

clinton
tried
,
and
tried
hard
.

the
gods
were
n't
with
us
on
that
one
.

that
is
how
i
want
you
to
refer
to
me
as
"
the
king
"

i
do
n't
think
so
.

i
'm
the
king

yeah

sounds
exciting
.

want
to
go
to
dinner
with
me
before
you
have
your
'
matt
time
'
?

probablyl
gon
na
just
kick
it

you
know
,
whatever
.

i
will
let
you
know
later
.

what
are
you
doing
tonight
.

like
what
?

i
can
think
of
a
few
things

you
r
retarded
.

i
used
to
have
one
.

they
are
great
dogs
.

cocker
spaniels
are
retarded
.

why
do
you
think
i
should
get
one
of
those
?

ca
n't
believe
you
left
last
night
.

nice
sarcasm
.

that
's
fine
,
i
do
n't
want
to
see
you
either
,
i
just
need
to
make
a
cd
.

i
ca
n't
wait

i
was
thinking
somewhere
that
requires
a
jacket
,
like
tony
's
.

someplace
that
is
like
$
30
an
entree
.

yeah
,
i
was
thinking
somewhere
like
mcdonald
's
.

that
may
be
too
nice
though
.

what
do
you
think
?

we
can
go
somewhere
nice
.

real
nice
.

oh
.

my
bad
.

i
must
have
had
you
messed
up
with
some
other
girl
i
made
the
bet
with
.

bet
?

really
,
i
have
no
idea
what
you
're
talking
about
.

you
must
be
thinking
of
someone
else
.

i
do
n't
even
like
a&m
,
i
would
n't
bet
on
them
.

colorado
beat
texas
a&m
.

i
know
you
remember
the
bet
.

no
.

i
got
her
number
though
.

i
want
to
hook
up
with
that
girl
paige
in
the
brown
leather
jacket
.

what
happened
to
you
?

i
had
a
blast
that
night
.

did
you
hook
up
with
that
blonde
chick
saturday
night
?

no
i
am
not
lying
.

i
flew
here
last
night
.

are
you
lying
?

i
am
out
of
town
.

i
am
in
portland
.

you
can
buy
me
dinner
when
we
get
back
.

i
am
sure
they
are
.

houston
wo
n't
be
too
affected
b/c
most
of
the
layoffs
affect
satelite
offices
.

economy
should
be
good
here
.

hopefully
she
does
n't
hose
you
.

i
'll
probably
start
looking
next
weekend
.

i
heard
that
more
may
be
going
up
for
sale
in
the
next
month
or
do
.

someone
told
me
that
chase
is
planning
a
shitload
of
layoffs
.

i
am
not
sure
how
reliable
that
is
,
though
.

she
is
waiting
to
see
if
she
can
get
financing
.

john
,

hello
from
south
america
.

i
just
got
your
email
and
i
certainly
concur
with
jeff
making
the
call
.

he
has
maintained
a
good
relationship
with
mulva
.

this
was
a
risk
that
we
had
but
we
did
have
assurances
from
phillips
regarding
performance
.

i
do
n't
know
how
much
it
will
help
however
.

richard
harper
and
mary
nell
browning
may
have
some
ideas
here
but
i
am
sure
you
've
already
gone
through
it
with
them
.

i
am
amazed
how
the
details
get
fuzzy
on
an
old
project
.

when
you
discussed
it
,
i
was
trying
to
think
back
to
our
remedies
and
discussions
but
the
3
years
have
made
it
difficult
.

i
do
n't
know
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
but
i
'm
always
willing
to
help
.

good
luck
,

mike

these
guys
tried

stephanie

not
sure
,
but
i
assume
that
the
bluegrass
songbook
is
mine
.

is
it
for
guitar
?

i
'll
need
to
ponder
.

i
'll
try
to
get
back
to
you
pronto
.

fyi
.

we
have
this
report
?

hi
david
:

thought
that
you
might
be
interested
.

best
,

jeff

well
,
he
launched
today
.

have
you
seen
the
materials
from
the
press
conference
that
he
launched
today
?

i
think
this
is
actually
a
good
thing
--
makes
our
proposal
look
like
a
much
more
preferable
alternative
by
comparison
,
makes
our
support
in
the
process
more
important
,
and
sets
harvey
up
as
the
ralph
nader
equivalent
in
the
election
to
fix
california
's
broken
system
---
a
potential
spoiler
.

hi
.

well
,
would
n't
you
know
it
.

i
'm
not
driving
tonite
,
but
i
bet
that
we
could
hitch
a
ride
back
with
anil
.

i
'm
not
sure
,
but
i
think
that
he
's
got
class
tonite
,
too
.

i
'll
search
him
out
before
class
or
after
that
break
and
see
if
i
can
set
it
up
.

daily
dose
on
enron
-

we
are
finished
.

i
need
to
now
get
a
job
at
house
of
pies
b/c
that
is
the
only
way
to
pay
the
bills
.

the
economy
is
down
and
when
enron
collapses
,
the
energy
industry
is
going
to
be
in
a
world
of
hurt
.

not
to
mention
the
market
is
going
to
be
flooded
with
enron
folks
.

ca
n't
go
to
any
more
lsu
games
unless
i
get
a
free
ticket
.

since
work
has
gone
to
hell
,
i
am
hoping
to
find
some
excitement
in
the
possibility
that
lsu
may
play
in
the
cotton
bowl
(
if
rohan
"
alabama
"
davey
shows
up
for
the
next
3
games
.
)

however
,
do
not
purchase
tickets
until
it
is
a
done
deal
-
a
lesson
i
learned
following
the
ark
game
last
season
.

i
have
stronger
will
than
you
think
.

house
of
pies
here
i
come
.

i
am
sure
i
could
have
persuaded
you
to
give
me
some
action
.

why
is
enron
blowing
up
?

i
did
n't
want
you
to
go
.

i
was
just
going
to
sleep
anyway
.

i
was
too
tired
to
give
you
any
action
.

enron
is
blowing
up
.

vince
,

we
are
still
trying
to
work
the
pse
swap
transaction
,
now
that
the
forex
desk
has
been
able
to
find
a
fix
for
cpi
in
the
market
.

further
to
my
voicemail
,
our
colleagues
in
credit
are
calculating
the
reserve
on
the
pse
swap
.

they
are
currently
using
9.5
%
fixed
based
on
the
1
year
implied
volatility
.

volatility
of
usd
/
dm
has
been
in
the
range
of
between
7
%
and
11
%
.

can
one
of
your
research
staff
justify
a
suitable
20
year
volalatility
number
for
usd
/
euro
.

ideally
,
we
would
like
a
fast
turnaround
.

in
addition
,
is
there
someone
who
could
consider
the
correlation
between
us
cpi
and
the
$
/
euro
exchange
rate
.

the
credit
guys
are
currently
assuming
that
there
is
no
correlation
and
may
consequently
be
double
dipping
the
credit
reserve
on
this
basis
too
.

grateful
for
any
help
or
suggestions
you
could
provide
.

sid

vincent
,

i
met
you
at
the
risk
conference
last
week
in
houston
.

i
enjoyed
your
presentations
very
much
.

i
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
some
references
regarding
the
calculation
of
correlation
coefficients
from
a
garch
model
.

thank
you

daren
,

i
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
ok
for
me
to
sit
in
with
you
one
day
to
get
a
general
feel
of
your
end
of
the
process
.

pat
had
told
me
before
he
left
that
it
would
help
me
better
grasp
the
process
as
a
whole
.

i
understand
the
imminent
cold
weather
is
making
things
crazy
,
so
now
may
not
be
the
best
time
to
be
in
your
way
.

but
let
me
know
if
i
can
spend
a
day
,
morning
,
or
even
just
an
afternoon
down
there
with
you
whenever
it
is
a
good
time
.

i
think
it
will
help
me
very
much
in
my
role
.

thanks

it
is
to
late
for
me
to
add
changes
.

we
will
have
to
correct
them
after
the
churn
.

thank
you
for
you
patience
.

the
dow
topped
out
in
february
of
1966
at
995
.

by
september
of
that
year
the
dow
had
tumbled
to
744
.

the
dow
then
rallied
to
a
high
of
943
in
september
of
'67
.

by
march
of
'68
the
dow
had
fallen
to
825
,
only
to
climb
to
a
highly
speculative
peak
of
985
in
december
of
'68
.

the
dow
then
sank
to
631
in
december
of
'70
.

by
april
of
'71
the
dow
had
climbed
back
to
950
,
only
to
fall
to
869
in
february
of
'72
.

a
big
rally
then
took
the
dow
(
unconfirmed
)
to
a
record
high
of
1051
in
january
of
'73
,
turning
everyone
bullish
.

but
by
december
of
'73
the
dow
had
collapsed
to
788
.

think
that
was
bad
-
by
december
of
'74
the
dow
had
sunk
to
a
bear
market
low
of
577
.

at
that
time
,
the
gurus
and
geniuses
of
wall
street
were
predicting
a
250
dow
and
many
were
talking
openly
about
the
end
of
capitalism
.

of
course
,
that
was
the
bottom

and
that
's
the
way
the
greatest
bear
market
since
the
depression
worked
its
way
down
.

by
late
1974
investors
were
dizzy
,
they
were
desperate
,
they
were
wrung
-
out
,
they
had
left
wall
street
,
many
for
good
.

great
,
we
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

the
results
of
the
february
26th
pvt
test
conducted
on
nville
have
been
discussed
with
each
of
you
over
the
last
three
months
.

as
we
have
discussed
....
effective
sep
13th
,
anita
will
make
the
adjustments
to
enron
's
inventory
and
pad
gas
to
reflect
the
february
26th
results
.

i
talked
with
gary
wilson
,
and
he
confirmed
that
the
revised
values
are
correct
.

attached
is
a
spreadsheet
that
contains
the
values
.

the
correction
to
the
working
gas
includes
two
corrections
.

the
results
of
the
february
26th
test
reduces
the
working
gas
by
398,487
mmbtu
.

in
addition
,
there
is
a
reduction
of
22,101
mmbtu
which
is
the
difference
between
the
scada
values
(
best
available
)
that
anita
showed
on
the
february
29th
storage
sheet
and
the
"
official
"
february
29th
values
that
gary
wilson
received
from
mips
.

to
summarize
:
enron
's
pad
gas
will
now
be
3,993,310
mmbtu
,
instead
of
4,223,000
mmbtu
.

enron
's
working
gas
will
be
reduced
by
420,588
mmbtu
.

call
me
if
there
are
any
questions
.

fyi

yeah
i
got
yelled
at
also
.

i
tried
to
say
i
was
n't
that
drunk
but
z
was
n't
having
any
of
that
conversation
.

she
told
me
that
after
friday
and
saturday
she
felt
i
was
slowly
regressing
.

then
i
told
her
i
felt
i
should
be
able
to
screw
missy
just
once
.

she
said
that
was
ok
.

did
you
get
in
as
much
trouble
as
i
did
this
weekend
-
lori
seems
to
think
i
need
to
get
help
-
i
told
her
it
's
normal
to
drink
all
day
at
a
bar
,
then
go
to
dinner
where
you
do
n't
know
half
the
people
there
and
proceed
to
get
extremely
fucked
up

bullshit
questions

i
'm
hearing
some
pretty
depressing

from
the

i
know
at

a
plenty
on

attached
are
clean
and
blacklined
drafts
of
the
enron
guaranties
to
be
made
in
support
of
epmi
's
obligations
under
the
indian
mesa
ii
renewable
energy
purchase
agreement
(
"
ppa
"
)
and
green
premium
sharing
agreement
(
"
gspa
"
)
.?

the
guaranty
for
the
ppa
is
blacklined
against
the
enron
epc
contract
guaranty
in
favor
of
the
banks
which
was
granted
in
connection
with
our
cabazon
wind
power
project
(
the
project
most
recently
financed
by
ewc
)
and
the
gpsa
guaranty
is
blacklined
against
the
ppa
guaranty
.

as
we
discussed
last
week
,
since
the
enron
guaranties
will
need
to
be
in
a
form
that
will
acceptable
to
our
project
lenders
and
equity
participants
,
we
thought
that
we
should
start
with
a
form
that
was
used
in
our
last
financing
and
that
was
negotiated
by
enron
and
the
banks
.

we
plan
to
use
the
same
basic
form
for
the
enron
guaranty
that
will
be
made
in
favor
of
epmi
with
respect
to
the
seller
's
obligations
under
the
ppa
.

we
will
forward
the
draft
of
that
guaranty
to
you
later
today
.

please
feel
free
to
give
me
a
call
if
you
have
any
questions
concerning
the
attached
guaranties
.

thank
you

vince
:

your
suggestion
to
introduce
the
concept
discussed
with
one
of
the
lays
is
welcomed
.

i
hope
that
this
would
mean
that
you
would
remain
involved
at
some
level
.

the
design
of
the
model
and
its
potential
economics
could
be
key
to
how
worthy
the
effort
might
be
.

enron
could
be
an
ideal
environment
from
which
to
the
concept
enhancement
through
to
commercialization
could
be
successfully
accomplished

please

share
matters

best

of
the
interest
generated
.

i

key

police

say
they

co-ordinator

financier
of
last
month
's
deadly
bomb
blasts
in

delhi

chief
k
k

named
the
man
as
tariq
ahmed

,
and
said
police
were
hunting
for
four
accomplices
.

he
said
mr

was
arrested
in

like
the

otto

(

)
aptly
summarised
the
nature
of
language
changes
by
comparing
it
with
one
of
the
theories
of
the
manchester
school
of
economics
:

'
everything
is
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
if
only
no
artificial
hindrances
are
put
in
the
way
of
free
exchange
,
for
demand
and
supply
will
regulate
everything
better
than
any
government
would
be
able
to
.
'

portia

this
is
a
beautiful
site
and
a
wonderful
idea
.

and
a
portion
of
each
package
or
memorial
purchased
goes
to
a
charity
on
their
database
.

so
be
sure
to
get
your
pet
's
memorial
on
the
site
and
if
you
have
a
charity
/
rescue
,
make
sure
it
is
listed
on
their
database
so
you
can
receive
some
of
the
profits
from
the
site
.

"
inhibitory

are

for

the

are
powerful
evidence
that
political

,
according
to
an
assessment
released
today
by
the
worldwatch
institute
.

alteration
of
the

the
destruction
of

(
from

,
president
bush
visited
chinese

the
talk

the

besides
a

was
north

china
has
been
a

bush
is
hoping
that
with
their
cooperation
korea

wei
ligang
,
a
rising
star
of
modern
art
in
china
,
just
had
an
exhibition
in
mid-july
,
2005
in
hong
kong
.

he
is
now
lecturing
in
usa
.

his
art
perfectly
combines
painting
and
chinese
calligraphy
.

he
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
leading
avant
-
garde
artist
of
modern
calligraphy
.

his
artworks
were
selected
and
exhibited
in
british
museum
in
2002
.

"
wei
has
given
some
virtuoso
performances
with
brush
and
ink
,
often
incorporating
several
different
techniques
into
a
single
work
,
"
said
gordon
s.
barrass
,
curator
of
the
exhibition
.

in
the
world
of
"
wei
's
magic
cubes
,
"
all
seem
to
be
ingeniously
planned
and
tricky
.

all
are
mathematical
,
all
are
linguistic
.

in
wei
's
art
,
a
logician
could
see
mathematical
logic
,
a
cellist
could
see
a
ripple
of
nine
bass
notes
,
a
country
girl
could
see
straw
,
and
harry
potter
could
see
two
accompanied
green
blazes
.

"
...
to
gaze
at
wei
's
art
is
like
entering
a
floating
world
of
dreams

technology
news

wiki
media
foundation
,
the
group
behind
the
wikipedia
online
encyclopedia
project
,
said
friday
that
search
giant
google
has
volunteered
to
host
some
of
its
content
on
company
servers
.

(
zd
net
)

it
looks
like
the
war
between
microsoft
and
google
is
quickly
brewing
on
the
horizon
.

microsoft
is
4
-
0
(
they
took
down
netscape
,
suns
systems
,
mac
and
ibm
)
and
google
may
be
their
next
target
.

google
is
probably
making
this
move
to
counter
microsoft
search
using
encarta
(
it's
online
dictionary
)
.

more
below
.

but
it
looks
like
google
is
n't
opening
it's
mouth
about
the
reason
behind
the
offer
as
linux
news
reports
:

"
while
we
do
n't
have
anything
specific
to
announce
today
,
google
and
the
wikimedia
foundation
are
collaboratively
evaluating
creative
ways
to
support
wikipedia.org
and
its
community
.
"

sure
google
,
although
this
would
put
it
on
coarse
for
global
domination
of
the
internet
by
2014
.

it
will
be
interesting
to
see
whether
or
not
google
will
finally
slay
the
microsoft
goliath
,
who
has
known
no
major
defeat
and
seeks
to
vanquish
all
competition
.

hello
there

action
network
is
a
bbc
website
for
people
who
are
taking
action
on
issues
that
concern
them
.

i
'm
getting
in
touch
because
i
think
it
could
be
useful
to
people
campaigning
about
hospital
closures
.

we
've
got
a
page
dedicated
to
issues
around
hospitals
(
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/c55153
)
and
a
group
called
nhs
sos
have
already
put
up
a
campaign
about
ward
closures
in
cumbria
.

i
'm
hoping
to
build
this
up
to
be
a
hub
for
all
the
campaigners
-
a
place
where
people
can
exchange
ideas
and
advice
.

it
would
be
great
if
the
person
from
chant
who
started
this
page
would
put
up
a
short
description
of
the
campaign
and
a
list
to
this
group
page
on
the
action
network
site
.

action
network
is
also
a
good
place
to
post
details
of
events
,
or
try
to
rally
together
a
group
if
you
want
to
take
action
in
your
area
.

you
can
attach
anything
you
write
to
pages
for
your
local
area
,
as
well
as
to
the
'
issue
'
pages
.

i
'm
more
than
happy
to
help
people
with
the
site
or
answer
any
questions
about
action
network
-
just
drop
me
a
message
.

otherwise
,
hope
to
see
you
there
!

regards

winston
peters
is
visiting
a
school
.

in
one
class
,
he
asks
the
students
if
anyone
can
give
him
an
example
of
a
"
tragedy
"
.

one
little
boy
stands
up
and
offers
that
,
"
if
my
best
friend
who
lives
next
door
was
playing
in
the
street
when
a
car
came
along
and
killed
him
,
that
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
no
,
"
winston
says
,
"
that
would
be
an
accident
.
"

a
girl
raises
her
hand
.

"
if
a
school
bus
carrying
fifty
children
drove
off
a
cliff
,
killing
everyone
involved
...
that
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
i
'm
afraid
not
,
"
explains
winston
,
"
that
is
what
we
would
call
a
great
loss
.
"

the
room
is
silent
,
none
of
the
other
children
volunteer
.

"
what
?
"
asks
winston
,
"
is
n't
there
any
one
here
who
can
give
me
an
example
of
a
tragedy
?
"

finally
,
a
boy
in
the
back
raises
his
hand
.

in
a
timid
voice
,
he
says
:
"
if
an
airplane
carrying
winston
peters
was
blown
up
by
a
bomb
,
that
would
be
a
tragedy
"
.

"
wonderful
!
"
winston
beams
.

"
marvelous
!

and
can
you
tell
me
why
that
would
be
a
tragedy
?
"

"
well
,
"
says
the
boy
,
"
because
it
would
n't
be
an
accident
,
and
it
certainly
would
n't
be
a
great
loss
!

it
looks
like
the
lunar
transportation
systems
,
inc.
is
visualizing
a
"
space
highway
"
going
from
the
moon
to
earth
(
and
back
again
)
.

"
our
new
lunar
transportation
system
utilizes
a
unique
architecture
that
will
establish
the
equivalent
of
a
two
-
way
highway
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
,
"
kistler
told
space.com
.

"
our
plans
include
raising
private
capital
to
develop
,
build
,
flight
test
,
and
operate
this
earth
-
moon
highway
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
and
the
benefit
of
our
investors
.
"

wise
decision
to
go
through
the
private
sector
--
nasa
's
budget
may
be
kinda
tight
to
fund
a
project
like
this
.

this
group
does
sound
pretty
interesting
though
.

the
lunar
transporatation
systems
(
lts
)
is
actually
being
funded
by
two
space
businessmen
,
walter
kistler
and
bob
citron
.

both
of
these
men
are
heavily
involved
in
the
private
sector
of
the
space
industry
,
and
both
are
also
involved
with
another
space
company
called
spacehab
.

they
want
to
use
lts
to
tie
into
nasa
's
vision
for
space
exploration
,
and
seem
pleased
that
the
white
house
is
moving
in
that
direction
.

"
we
are
so
excited
that
the
white
house
and
the
recent
new
government
space
policy
underscores
the
need
to
involve
the
private
sector
in
assisting
nasa
develop
its
plans
for
the
new
vision
for
space
exploration
,
"
said
walter
kistler
,
lts
co-founder
and
chairman
.

with
their
proposal
of
a
"
earth
-
moon
"
highway
,
it
looks
like
space
tourism
may
become
a
reality
sooner
than
we
think
.

(
space.com
)

u.s.
astronauts
will
launch
to
the
moon
on
sleek
,
single
,
shuttle
booster
rockets
and
the
first
new
upper
-
stage
rocket
this
country
has
developed
in
more
than
a
decade
,
nasa
and
the
pentagon
have
told
the
white
house
.

lunar
landers
and
other
gear
needed
for
extended
visits
to
the
moon
will
be
lofted
by
gargantuan
launchers
as
big
as
the
apollo
-
era
saturn
5
,
the
most
powerful
rockets
ever
flown
.

it
looks
as
if
nasa
is
transitioning
away
from
the
shuttle
model
,
as
in
the
past
they
have
proven
to
be
quite
dangerous
as
columbia
has
recently
proved
.

although
these
new
rockets
are
probably
more
expensive
,
they
will
be
able
to
go
at
a
much
greater
range
than
it's
shuttle
cousins
,
as
they
can
not
only
break
free
from
the
atmosphere
but
reach
the
moon
as
well
.

"
nasa
will
initiate
development
of
a
crew
launch
vehicle
derived
from
space
shuttle
solid
rocket
boosters
with
a
new
upper
stage
for
human
spaceflight
,
"
said
the
letter
,
signed
by
nasa
administrator
mike
griffin
and
the
pentagon
's
top
space
official
,
ex-astronaut
ron
sega
...

"
nasa
then
plans
to
develop
a
new
100
-
metric
-
ton
-
class
launch
vehicle
derived
from
existing
capabilities
with
the
space
shuttle
external
tanks
and
solid
rocket
boosters
for
future
missions
to
the
moon
,
"
the
letter
said
.

nasa
is
planning
on
using
these
new
shuttles
to
replace
the
current
models
,
with
industry
forecasters
predicting
a
launch
as
early
as
2014
.

the
new
rocket
design
will
differ
slightly
from
it's
predecessors
,
in
the
fact
that
the
crew
and
cargo
would
launch
separately
from
two
different
rockets
each
and
join
up
in
space
later
on
.

launching
this
way
will
hopefully
avoid
future
disasters
,
giving
more
support
towards
nasa
revisiting
the
stars
.

yes

yes
you
can
carry

studying

if
i
went
into

pre-university
"
direction
with
business
administration
in
mind
.

say
after
i
finished
those
2
years
and
i
found

would
i
be
able
to
go
back
to

after
a

break
at
a

to
get
a
bachelor
s
degree
in

any
information
would
help
.

thank
you

you
should
be
able
to
no
problem
.

universities
will
take
you
whatever
age
you
are
.

what
would
you
call
the
device
that
hold
up
your
photography
backdrop
?

and
where
can
i
find
them
?

background
support
systems
.

or
background
stands

buy
them
in
any
good
photography
supplies
shop
.

frame

thumbs
down
???

odd
considering
this
is
a
search
on

backdrop
stand
.

google
the
term
or
find
photography
supplies
websites
and
put
it
in
the
search
box
(
or
look
for
studio
equipment
supplies
)
.

out
of
carnival
,
royal
caribbean
,
and
norweigan
(
cruises
)
which
is
the
best
and
why
?

i
prefer
royal
caribbean
out
of
all
these
.

there
is
so
much
to
do
onboard
.

the
new
ncl
epic
does
sound
amazing
,
although
i
have
n't
sailed
on
her
yet
.

none
of
the
above
.

of
these
three
,
it
's
a
toss
-
up
between
royal
and
carnival
.

ncl
is
a
notch
below
either
,
in
terms
of
quality
and
service
.

will
usb
cell
phone
chargers
still
charge
even
if
they
're
hooked
up
to
a
computer
that
is
turned
off
?

mine
does
.

i
have
the
htc
evo
.

depends
on
the
computer

if
the
computer
is
completely
shut
off
,
the
usb
ports
are
n't
getting
power
,
so
they
wo
n't
charge
your
phone

many
pcs
have
sleep
&
charge
now
,
that
allow
the
pc
to
go
into
sleep
mode
,
and
still
allow
the
usb
ports
to
charge
things
like
phones
.

what
are
some
cool
ideas
for
making
a
postor
usint
the
word
mad
on
a
white
paper
in
a
weird
or
artsy
way
?

the
actual
word
"
mad
"
has
to
be
on
the
cover
and
incorporated
into
the
image
.

mad
means
crazy
,
or
angry
,
so
you
do
a
lot
with
it
,
i
would
put
a
gorrilla
screaming
,
just
the
face
,
and
just
throw
in
a
lot
of
brushes
fifferent
colors
,
make

what
is
the
fall
of
hanoi
?

can
anyone
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
and
what
took
place
?

i
ca
nt
find
any
information
about
it

when
the
french
returned
to
indochina
at
the
end
of
ww
ii
the
viet
minh
were
in
control
of
the
red
river
delta
.

they
chased
the
communists
out
of
the
capital
(
hanoi
)
and
retook
control
.

is
that
what
you
are
referring
to
?

you
need
to
check
out
the
french
indochina
war
(
1946

1954
)
not
the

does

no
,
technically
they
do
not

they
are
nocturnal

however
,
it
certainly
would
n't
hurt
if
you
wanted
to
provide
one

a

20
fluid
ounces
in
a
pint
in
ireland

as
r
-
g
said
,
there
are
only
16
in
an
american
one
.

know
this
well
because
i
remember
an
'
irish
'
pub
in
the
town
in
canada
i
grew
up
in
used
to
advertise
the
cheapest
pints
of
guinness
in
town
,
but
they
served
them
in
american
sized
pints
.

that
place
did
n't
stay
open
too
long
:d

need
help
finding
irish
music
?

i
love
the
script
and
know
the
re
from
iraland
.

i
would
like
more
bands
like
them
pleasseee

the
thing
about
the
script
is
they
do
not
sound
that
irish
,
i
was
surprised
to
hear
they
were
from
dublin
.

well
if
you
are
interested
,
i
suggest
you
have
a
look
at
general
fiasco
,
two
door
cinema
club
and
wallis
bird
.

i
think
you
will
be
pleased
.

i
doubt
you
will
get
a
sensible
answer
in
the
"
travel
"
section
.

*
ireland

and
there
's
nothing
distinctly
irish
about
them
.

you
'd
find
similar
bands
to
them
that
are
from
the
uk
and
us
.

women
's
rain
coat
...
where
can
i
find
one
?

i
'm
going
on
a
trip
to
europe
soon
,
and
i
need
to
find
a
good
,
quality
raincoat
.

i
've
looked
and
looked
,
but
can
not
find
one
anywhere
!

i
would
prefer
a
simple
,
fitted
black
one
.

it
actually
needs
to
be
relatively
waterproof
-
the
last
one
i
bought
had
me
soaked
in
anything
more
than
light
/
moderate
rain
.

i
'll
pay
up
to
200
-
250
for
it
if
i
have
to
.

look
on
the
debenhams
website

in
the
craghoppers
section

they
do
some
good
waterproof
raincoats

you
do
n't
...
there
's
no
such
thing
as
"
pause
"
in
digital
recording
.

that
's
because
of
the
buffer
that
holds
the
data
until
it
's
ready
to
be
recorded
to
the
memory
card
.

when
you
press
the
button
to
stop
recording
the
data
is
moved
from
the
buffer
to
the
memory
card
-
no
pause
.

all
you
can
do
is
take
each
section
(
individual
video
)
and
edit
them
together
on
software
.

i
have
a

is
driving
to
cure
the
influenza
guy
does
he
say
to
the
man
with
the
cow
i
like
your
blouse
or
i
like
your
cow
because
my
friend
thinks
he
says
i
like
your
blouse
,
but
that
would
n't
make
sense
.

i
know
it
s
in
the
wrong
catagory
,
but
still
,
i
wrote
this
question
for
a
reason
,
not
for
you
to
critisize
me
.

okay
,
first
,
you
have
posted
a
question
about
an
american
movie
,
set
in
mexico
,
in
the
dining
out
in
argentina
category
.

do
you
get
what
's
wrong
with
this
picture
?

no
...
that
's
all
.

no
second
.

nacho

is
suppose
to
be

not

a

burger
formula
that
started
about
80
years
ago
.

there
are
currently
5
locations

the

for

is

along

try
a

of
onion
rings
if
you
are
with

otherwise
a

will
be
fine

my
dog
has
threw
up
yellow
bile
for
two
days
but
does
not
have
dhirea
.

what
should
i
do
?

i
've
tried
bland
white
rice
but
he
wo
nt
eat
anything
.

what
could
it
be
?

should
i
be
concerned
?

call
a
vet
would
be
a
good
idea
with
a
sick
dog

very
concerned
!!!

plz
bring
your
dog
to
the
vet
asap
!!!

esp
if
not
eating
-
if
it
had
only
happened
once
and
could
get
him
to
eat
right
away
-
it
could
have
been
you
missed
his
meal
time
and
he
needed
to
eat
-
since
it
sounds
like
it
has
happened
several
times
over
two
days
-
then
he
may
have
gotten
int
to
something
that
needs
to
be
attended
to
right
away
!!!

or
has
acquired
some
type
of
disease
and
that
too
needs
to
be

why
are
there
two
statues
of
david
?

i
doing
a
research
paper
on
donatello
and
i
notice
that
there
are
two
statues
of
david
,
a
bronze
one
and
marble
one
.

michelangelo
made
the
marble
one
but
why
did
he
do
another
if
donatello
had
already
made
one
?

so
i
m
a
little
confused
,
why
is
there
two
statues
of
david
?

different
generations
,
the
donatello
is
of
a
boy
david
as
a
young
sheep
herder
,
the
michelangelo
is
the
grown
up
man
david
as
slayer
and
king

because
he
liked
making
statues
of
david
!
:d

obviously
,
he
should
have
been
arrested
and
jailed
-
imagine
making
a
statue
or
painting
on
the
same
subject
as
another
artist
-
clearly
insulting
and
disrespecting
-
wasted
time
that
could
have
been
used
making
a
statue
with
clothes
on
.

name
of
specific
hibachi
restaurant
in
chicago
?

i
have
a
friend
out
in
chicago
this
week
,
and
i
am
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
an
awesome
hibachi
style
restaurant
i
visited
while
out
there
a
couple
years
ago
.

i
think
it
was
in
the
lincoln
square
area
but
do
n't
quote
me
on
that
.

it's
'
gimmick
'
was
that
you
fill
your
bowl
cafeteria
-
style
from
raw
ingredients
and
leave
it
on
the
counter
with
a
chopstick
listing
your
table
number
on
it
.

four
guys
around
a
large
square
open
hibachi
cook
your
food
,
and
when
it
's
finished
a
server
brings
it
to
your
table
.

all
-
you
can
-
eat
style
deal
.

it
was
pretty
epic
as
i
remember
and
would
love
to
send
my
friend
there
.

any
help
?

what
's
the
best
time
to
start
a
trip
around
the
world
?

well
,
i
'm
about
to
graduate
in
less
then
a
year
,
and
i
'm
planning
to
study
medical
school
.

but
since
in
my
country
it
lasts
for
minimum
6
years
,
and
i
want
to
go
aground
the
world
,
what
do
you
think
,
should
i
do
it
before
or
after
medical
school
?

if
you
can
afford
to
go
before
,
then
by
all
means
,
go
.

if
you
have
to
wait
,
due
to
financial
reasons
,
then
wait
.

i
would
much
rather
put
it
off
until
i
can
afford
to
have
the
vacation
of
a
lifetime
as
i
'm
sure
this
trip
is
intended
to
be
.

airfare
alone
will
be
incredibly
expensive
so
make
sure
you
have
the
money
and
of
course
free
time
to
take
your
time
and
have
a
great
time
.

canon
t2i
stops
working
?

my
canon
t2i
stops
working
at
times
as
in
the
power
bottom
is
switched
to
"
on
"
but
the
camera
does
not
respond
to
any
function
.

the
camera
only
begins
to
work
again
when
i
take
out
the
battery
and
put
it
back
in
.

did
anyone
have
this
issue
?

is
it
worthy
to
send
in
for
warranty
repair
?

thanks
!

sounds
simple
enough
to
me
.

your
camera
is
n't
acting
normally
,
you
got
warranty
,
let
canon
deal
with
it
.

i
would
agree
.

i
shoot
a
t1i
and
have
n't
had
such
an
issue
.

i
also
agree
it
's
under
warranty
so
get
in
touch
with
canon
.

it
sounds
like
a
firmware
issue
and
the
camera
requires
a
re-boot
just
like
what
happens
in
a
computer
-
needs
a
re-start
from
time
to
time
but
it
should
n't
be
happening
in
a
camera
.

cheapest
airline
ticket
from
raleigh
to
philippines
?

i
'm
going
on
a
vacation
to
the
philippines
in
may
2012
,
and
i
'm
starting
from
raleigh
,
nc
(
rdu
airport
)
.

which
airlines
should
i
look
into
and
when
should
i
buy
my
ticket
?

the
sooner
the
better
but
i
'd
probably
wait
until
after
the
holidays
.

use
travelocity
or
expedia
and
see
what
you
come
up
with
.

my
friend
goes
to
the
phils
every
6
months
or
so
and
she
has
found
that
korean
air
has
had
the
cheapest
fares
lately
.

raleigh
to
chicago
,
chicago
to
seoul
and
then
seoul
to
manila
.

compare
compare
compare
-
that
's
the
key
to
getting
the
best
deal
.

ask
a
travel
agent
!

on
my
last
6
trips
here
from
the
states
i
used
"
fly
genesis
"
based
in
seattle
,
wa
.

they
gave
the
best
service
&
rates
i
could
find
.

what
is
the
best
place
to
get
discounts
for
san
francisco
restaurants
?

i
just
moved
into
the
city
,
and
i
'm
wondering
if
there
's
a
place
i
can
get
good
deals
on
restaurants
here
.

i
do
n't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
those
deal
-
a
-
day
websites
like
groupon
.

i
just
want
a
simple
way
to
get
a
good
deal
to
whatever
restaurant
i
want
,
whenever
i
want
.

any
suggestions
would
be
really
helpful
,
thanks
!

i
usually
use
zebraklub
.

they
basically
buy
daily
deals
from
groupon
,
living
social
,
and
all
sorts
of
other
places
.

so
you
can
pretty
much
get
whatever
deal
you
want
anytime
.

most
of
the
deals
let
you
eat
for
500
ff
,
and
some
of
the
deals
are
even
free
.

if
you
want
to
eat
cheaply
without
worrying
about
all
those
daily
deal
emails
every
day
,
zebraklub
should
be
perfect
for
you
.

where
can
i
go
on
a
first
date
(
adults
)
?

looking
for
something
on
the
casual
side
and
we
want
it
to
be
fun
.

may
seem
a
little
silly
,
but
,
taking
a
long
ride
on
the
metra
system
or
the
"
l
"
system
is
a
great
way
to
see
the
city
and
sites
without
spending
a
fortune
.

or
how
about
visiting
the
chicago
botanical
gardens
and
see
the
change
of
colors
and
enjoy
the
air
,
they
also
have
many
inside
exhibits
you
might
enjoy
,
food
is
pretty
good
to
.

go
2
starbucks
do
nt
spend
more
than
20
bucks
:)

bike
ride
in
the
park
,
followed
by
coffee
.

you
are
busy
,
you
do
n't
have
to
sit
face
to
face
to
try

to
make
convo
,
it
's
short
,
so
if
things
go
great
,
you
can

extend
,
and
if
you
want
to
end
it
,
you
just
say
bye
,

got

go

i
decided
to
get
a
150
gal
aquarium
,
what
can
i
fill
it
with
?

i
was
thinking
cichlids
?

possibly
a
freshwater
tank
with
a
ton
of
different
species
in
there
.

i
've
never
kept
cichlids
though
.

i
know
saltwater
is
a
possibility
,
can
you
give
me
a
possible
stocking
option
for
that
too
?

i
'll
choose
the
one
that
sounds
the
best
after
looking
into
all
the
fish
:)

here
is
the
stocking
for
my
150
gallon
tank
i
upgraded
it
to
200
at
the
weekend
because
of
the
clownloach
a
200
gallon
with
6
pairs
of
breeding
angel
fish
fire
mouth
honey
gouramis
5
8
inch
clownloach
a
krib
and
5
1
inch
clown
loach
with
16
cory
cats
5
australian
rainbows

if
you
took
out
the
clown
loach
it
would
make
a
nice
150
gallon
tank
.

fill
it
with
water
:)
lol

for
a
tank
that
size
i
would
suggest
oscars
or
piranha
every
time

they
have
always
done
a
great
job
at
a
reasonable
price
.

highly
recommended

not
impressed
.

overpriced
and
the
doctor
acted
arrogant
and
rushed
at
a
time
when
there
was
very
few
clients
in

.

i
wo
n't

ie
nothing

implied
or
assumed
)
.

i
gave
dr.
rohatgi
2
stars
because
her
assistant
was
very
pleasant
.

however
,
i
did
not
find
her
very
helpful
and
her
receptionist
was
rude
.

extremely
greasy
.

hit
or
miss
on
the

.

my
fries
were
n't
fully
cooked
last
time
i
went

pretty
spendy

the

are
superb

i
worked
with

mones
who
took
great
care

because
they

worst

this
place
had
the
worst
tasting
pizza
i
have
ever
tasted
it
was
possible
the
worst
food
i
've

eaten
.

i
do
n't
recommend
this

to
anyone
or
even
anything
to
eat
.

not
so
good

not
worth
the
money
.

bland
and
over
cooked
.

i
felt
as
if
i
was
in
an
over
priced
olive
garden
.

i
was
hoping
to
have
found
a
regular
place
to
eat
.

but
not
so
.

i
have
used
bright
futures
for
the
last
7
years
.

i
have
3
children
there
and
they
are
the
best
.

they
are

your

will
be
taken

no
feathers

i
was
very
upset
when
i
went
to
mother
plucker
,
they
had
no
feathers
and
the
quality
is
terrible
.

i
had
to
dig
in
a
bag
to
find
one
nice
feather
,
what
a
joke
!

gets
the
job
done

we
have
utilized
mr.
pozza
and
his
firm
twice
now
in
our
family
and
both
times
have
been
very
pleased
.

i
would
not
hesitate
to
use
him
again
or
refer
him
to
my
family
or
friends

farrell

is
a
very
good
electrical
contractor

i
'm
pleased
that
someone
referred
me
to
them

i
own

cleanest
guesthouse
i
have
been
to

stayed
here
for
2
nights
.

the
owner
was
very
friendly
and
helpful
.

the
rooms
were
very
clean
and
the
breakfast
was
excellent
.

good
location
and
off
road
parking
made
our
stay
very
convenient
.

these
guys
do
great
work
at
very
reasonable
prices
.

i
have
use
them
four
times
for
fixing
items
from
pushing
out
a
dent
in
a
bumper
to
fixing
the
fender
on
my
beloved
miata
.

i
have
never
been
disappointed
.

do
n't
waste
your

on
the

the
bartender
is
a
douchebag
and
he
has
a
little
console
behind
the
bar
where
he
can
delete
songs
he
does
n't
like
,
and
you
end
up
paying
for
it

great

really
great

and

the

was
inexpensive
and
so
were
the

(
eyebrows
were
cheap
!
)
.

it
's
a
nice
,
relaxed
place
to
get

done
and
relax
.

i
plan
on
going
again
.

amazing
customer
service

i
think
the
women
at
this
salon
know
that
their
business
is
based
primarily
from
referrals
.
:)

they
were
amazingly
hospitable
.

edit
was
the
best
massage
therapist
i
've
ever
had
and
i
would
highly
recommend
her
!

good

only
looks

,
inside
is

bad
.

too
many
bugs
some
you
even
never
seen

the
attitude
of
some

is
terrible
,
did
not
solve
anything
only
say
i
can
do
nothing
.

great
tmobile
service

i
was
with
verizon
and
i
checked
my
service
with
tmobile
and
it
was
great
so
i
thought
i
would
try
tmobile
.

it
turned
out
being
very
good
quality
tmobile
service
and
i
was
happy
with
the
new

best
dentist
ever
-

very
fast
and
efficient
service
.

i
have
had
several
dentists
in
my
life
,
but
dr.
deters
is
by
far
my
favorite
.

i
never
wait
in
the
waiting
room
more
than
two
minutes
and
the
cleanings
are
quick
and
painless
.

this
is
a
great
place
to
shop
.

i
've
been
a
regular
customer
at
this
store
since
it
opened
,
and
love
the
fact
that
all
of
the
employees
are
friendly
locals
.

particularly
the
lady
who
operates
the
front
register
,
she
's
very
kind
!

great

and
great

the

is
easy
to

and
it
keeps
the
cold
out
during
the

.

the
sales
staff
and
the
installation
staff
were
all
easy
to
get
along
with
.

i
highly
recommend

to
my

umm
...

okay
,
i
do
nt
have
a
review
,
but
why
in
the
hell
would
you
name
your
business
something
that
has
the
initials
kkk
....
is
there
something
behind
the
scenes
at
this
place
?

like
i
'm
legitimately
concerned
at
this
point
...
lol

fresh
and
excellent
quality

we
order
take
out
from
here
all
the
time
and
we
are
never
disappointed
.

the
food
is
always
fresh
and
delicious
.

it
can
be
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
but
just
ask
them
exactly
what
you
want
and
they
are
very
helpful
.

i
really
want
to
like
this
place
since
i
work
right
around
the
corner
.

unfortunately
,
i
've
given
it
a
couple
of
tries
at
different
times
and
decided
to
stop
going
.

the
employees
do
n't
really
seem
to
enjoy
what
they
are
doing
and
it
shows
.

class
act
.

it
was
late
in
the
day
and
i
was
worried
i
would
get
charged
an
arm
and
a
leg
and
have
to
wait
forever
.

they
picked
my
car
up
in
yarmouth
and
towed
to
bath
for
a
great
price
.

would
do
business
with
them
again
.

great
service

we
at
r&l
plumbing
services
are
pleased
with
your
professionalism
and
the
extra
mile
you
went
to
get
out

working
correctly
,
you
will
be
our
first
call
if
anything
happens
again
and
we
will
refer
you
to

from

this
could
n't
be
farther
from
the
truth
.

the
food
is
amazing
,
and
the
prices
can
not
be
beat
.

the

is
great
,
and
they
have
a
great

great
work
!

the
people
at
gulf
coast

were
very
easy
and
clear
to
work
with
.

they
walked
me
through
all
the
steps
involved
in
the
the
installation
project
so
that
there
were
no
surprises
.

i
found
them
extremely
professional
and
would
highly
recommend
them
.

thanks

slow
service

i
used
to
take
my
cars
there
all
the
time
,
but
management
changes
hands
too
frequently
,
the
service
has
been
slow
,
and
they
often
try
to
"
add
on
"
extra
services
,
which
sometimes
is
not
needed
.

i
do
nt
go
there
anymore

great
service

these
people
were
so
helpful
this
week
and
did
everything
to
sort
out
my
windscreen
and
insurance
.

it
was
all
sorted
with
no
hassle
at
all
and
i
'm
really
grateful
-
they
were
fab
.

is
a
good
indication
of
her
talent

she
's
the

teeth

this
dentist
want
to
pull
the
tooth
out
always
..
always
wants
to
do
the
cheapest
for
his
benefit
..
not
unless
he
knows
you
.

and
hopefully
you
do
not
know
the
same
people
because
he
tells
others
about
you
payment
status
.

which
should
be
a
private
issue

i
hired
this
company
to
unlock
my
car
.

the
price
they
gave
was
good
so
i
said
hey
this
seems
great
.

after
they
showed
up
there
was
a
little
trouble
to
get
my
car
unlocked
,
it
took
quite
a
bit
of
time
but
the
job
was
well
done
.

bulwark
regarding
service
by
eric

just
wanted
you
to
know
that
eric
came
by
as
scheduled
today
and
sprayed
our
house
for
scorpions
.

he
seemed
to
understand
how
important
it
was
for
us
to
make
sure
the
whole
house
was
sprayed
so
he
took
his
time
.

thank
you
!

a
terrible
experience
!

i
remain
unhappy
.

i
still
have
noticeable
scarring
.

i
still
have
surgically
induced
hair
loss
.

my
results
were
just
awful
.

my
post-op
treatment
was
terrible
.

i
would
n't
recommend
this
place
last
year
,
and
i
certainly
would
n't
recommend
them
this
year
.

my
favorite
place
...

my
daughter
and
i
stayed
here
again
from
the
7th
to
the
14th
of
december
.

yet
again
it
was
a
great
stay
from
begiinning
to
end
.

okay
our
room
was
at
times
noisy
but
we
were
in
a
mega
busy
city
at
an
extremely
busy
time
of
year
.

a
definite
no

incompetent
servers
,
kitchen
and
management
.

expect
either
undercooked
or
mushy
food
and
lackluster
service
.

the
investors
put
big
bucks
into
the
building
but
are
clueless
about
what
makes
a
good
dining
or
bar
experience
.

even
the
least
discriminating
diner
would
know
not
to
eat
at
sprecher
's
.

wonderful
atmosphere

i
have
been
going
there
since
i
was
a
little
girl
and
love
the
friendly
and
relaxing
atmosphere
.

dr.

condition

do
n't
know
where
to
start
when
it
comes

i
just

they

michael
helped
shoot
the
majority
of
my
firm
's
website
and
we
could
not
have
been
happier
.

we
went
through
six
photographers
to
find
the
right
photographers
that
would
represent
our
firm
in
the
light
we
wished
to
and
michael
and
his

made
that
happen

he
's

average
food
and
deathly
slow
service

i
have
eaten
here
several
times
and
every
time
the
service
is
slower
than
slow
.

one
time
we
even
left
after
sitting
at
the
table
for
20
minutes
and
not
being
greeted
with
a
drink
order
.

ridiculous
.

there
must
be
a
better
mexican
place
in
rockland
.

i
am
in
love
with
the
giant
plate
of
nachos
!

last
time
i
went
however
,
my
beer
was
warm
and
the
service
was
so
-
so
.

i
get
that
careless
teenager
kind
of
treatment
from
some
of
their
staff
...
perhaps
they
should
hire
more
serious
adults
to
help
serve
/
cook

very
mediocre
donuts
!

the
donuts
were
very
over
proofed
,
making
them
stale
and
bready
.

the
service
was
friendly
and
fast
,
but
this
just
does
nt
make
up
for
the
lack
-
luster
product
.

we
tried
4
different
style
of
donuts
,
they
were
all
the
same
when
it
came
to
quality
.

a
staple

i
